# SIFT3D for Matlab

Copyright (c) 2015-2016 Blaine Rister et al., see LICENSE for details.

## Contents

This is a Matlab toolbox wrapping SIFT3D. It contains the following functions:
- detectSift3D.m - Detect SIFT3D keypoints from a 3-dimensional array.
- extractSift3D.m - Extract SIFT3D descriptors from a 3-dimensional array.
- keypoint3D.m - Create SIFT3D keypoints from user-supplied coordinates.
- orientation3D.m - Assign 3D orientations to user-supplied keypoints.
- registerSift3D.m - Register images using SIFT3D keypoints and descriptors.
- imRead3D.m - Read 2D and 3D images in DICOM and NIFTI formats.
- imWrite3D.m - Write 2D and 3D images in DICOM and NIFTI formats.

## Installation instructions

If you installed SIFT3D from binaries, a Matlab toolbox is included in the lib/wrappers/matlab subdirectory of your installation. If you compiled SIFT3D from source, the toolbox will be built only if Matlab was detected in your system.

To use the toolbox, simply add it to your Matlab path. This can be accomplished by adding the following line to your startup.m file:

        run('/path/to/sift3d/lib/wrappers/matlab/setupSift3D')

where /path/to/sift3d is the path to your SIFT3D installation. If you do not have a startup.m file, you can simply run this command prior to calling any SIFT3D functions.

### Relocating the toolbox

We do not recommend moving the toolbox shared libraries (.so, .dylib, .dll). If you do, the operating system may not be able to find them when it tries to load the mex files. A better solution is to install SIFT3D in the place you want the toolbox to reside.

### Troubleshooting

#### Matlab not found

When compiling from source, CMake might fail to find Matlab on your system, especially on Mac OSX. In that case, you should see "Matlab not found" after running the cmake command. You can fix this by manually specifying the location of Matlab in the variable Matlab_ROOT_DIR. For example,

        cmake .. -DMatlab_ROOT_DIR=/path/to/MATLAB

or on Mac OSX,

        cmake .. -DMatlab_ROOT_DIR=/path/to/Matlab.app

where /path/to/MATLAB is the location of your Matlab installation.

#### glibcxx version not found

If you compile SIFT3D vith a newer version of G++ than is supported by your version of Matlab, you may receive an error saying that the required version of glibcxx cannot be found. The solution is to compile SIFT3D with a different version of G++. For example, on Ubuntu 20.04, with G++ 7 installed,

        cmake .. -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/usr/bin/g++-7

## Usage instructions

For instructions on using the Matlab functions, use the help pages, e.g.

        help detectSift3D

See /examples for sample programs.

## Advanced features

This toolbox also includes a test suite, Sift3DTest.m. The test suite is found only in the source distribution, not the binary distributions, and must be run from the build tree. It requires [xUnit](http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/22846-matlab-xunit-test-framework) to run. You can run the test suite with the following command:

        runtests
